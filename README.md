# Flask Server Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Flask server implementation designed to handle crop information and Growing Degree Days (GDD) calculations. The server consists of several key components and dependencies required for running the application.

## Contents
- `app.py`: The main Flask application file.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of dependencies required to run the Flask application.
- `Procfile`: Used for deploying the application on Heroku.
- `your_crop_info_module.py`: Module handling crop information.
- `your_gdd_module.py`: Module handling Growing Degree Days calculations.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adedapo17/Flask_server.git
   cd Flask_server
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Server
Start the Flask server locally by running:
```bash
python app.py
```
By default, the server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Deployment
To deploy the application to Heroku:
1. Ensure the `Procfile` is included in the root directory.
2. Create a Heroku app:
   ```bash
   heroku create
   ```
3. Push the code to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku master
   ```
4. Open the deployed app in your browser:
   ```bash
   heroku open
   ```

## Usage
The Flask server handles various endpoints related to crop information and GDD calculations. For detailed API documentation, refer to the function definitions and docstrings within `app.py`, `your_crop_info_module.py`, and `your_gdd_module.py`.
